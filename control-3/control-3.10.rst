Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 3.2: Establish and Maintain a Data Inventory
* Safeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process

Inputs
------
#. :code:`GV12`: Sensitive data Inventory
#. :code:`GV3`: Configuration Standards

Operations
----------
#. For each item in :code:`GV12`, identify the means and components for encrypting data in transit.
#. Compare the output of Operation 1 with :code:`GV5` to check appropriate approved configurations
	#. Enumerate the data items in :code:`GV12` that are properly configured (M2)
	#. Enumerate the data items in :code:`GV12` that are improperly configured (M3)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of items in :code:`GV12` 
* M2 = Count of data with properly configured encryption components
* M3 = Count of data with improperly configured encryption components
